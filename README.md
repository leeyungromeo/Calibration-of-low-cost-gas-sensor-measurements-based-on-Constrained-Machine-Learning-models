# Calibration-of-low-cost-gas-sensor-measurements-based-on-Constrained-Machine-Learning-models
This thesis takes an in-depth look at the problem of calibrating low-cost gas sensors through the use of machine learning models imposing specific constraints. The research draws on data from two main sources: the Cellule Interrégionale de l'Environnement (IRCELINE) and Vocsens, a manufacturer of low-cost gas sensors. The main objective is to overcome the challenges commonly associated with the accuracy and reliability of these sensors, which are crucial for air quality monitoring but are often limited by cost and manufacturing constraints.

By introducing an innovative calibration method that incorporates machine learning constraints, this study demonstrates a significant improvement in sensor performance. The results reveal a significant increase in measurement accuracy, underlining the transformative potential of this approach for low-cost environmental monitoring. Indeed, the use of these advanced techniques makes air monitoring more accessible and economical, while maintaining accuracy comparable to that of more expensive devices.
